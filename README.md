# Project-Sahay
Sahay - A Proactive AI Wellness Ecosystem for Students
Sahay is an innovative web platform designed for the Smart India Hackathon 2025, aimed at tackling the student mental health crisis and preventing dropouts in India. It moves beyond traditional, reactive support systems by creating a proactive, culturally-aware, and data-driven wellness ecosystem.

🚀 The Problem
Student mental health support in India often fails because it is reactive (acting only after a crisis), generic (using Western models that don't fit our cultural context), and provides zero insight to colleges, leaving them blind to the real problems on campus. This leads to high stress, anxiety, and ultimately, preventable student dropouts.

✨ Our Solution: A Multi-Featured Ecosystem
Sahay is an integrated platform that acts as a student's personal companion and a strategic partner for their institution. It uses the power of the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent, empathetic, and personalized support across a suite of powerful tools.

Key Features
🧠 AI-Powered Clarity Engine: Helps students turn career anxiety and academic confusion into a clear, actionable roadmap. By analyzing their passions and worries, the AI provides personalized career suggestions, motivational reframes, and concrete next steps.

🗓️ Proactive "Wellness Watch" Engine: Simulates a Google Calendar integration to scan for high-stress events like exams and deadlines. It then provides timely, AI-generated "nudges" with specific advice to help students prepare and cope, preventing burnout before it starts.

💬 Gemini AI Companion: A 24/7 chatbot that understands "Hinglish" and Indian cultural contexts, providing a safe, confidential, and non-judgmental space for students to talk. Includes an AI-powered summarization feature for reflection.

🛤️ AI-Personalized Wellness Pathways: Structured, 5-day wellness programs curated by the Gemini API based on a student's specific goals, like "Conquer Exam Anxiety" or "Improve Sleep Quality."

🌗 Sleek, Responsive UI with Dark Mode: A beautiful, modern, and accessible user interface that works flawlessly on all devices and includes a theme toggle for user comfort.
